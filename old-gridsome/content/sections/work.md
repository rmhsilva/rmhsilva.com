### The Hark Programming Language
https://www.condense9.com

Making data pipelines and similar cloud applications easier to build and
operate.


### LispMethods
https://www.lispmethods.com

A growing collection of articles about writing Common Lisp, with aimed at people
coming from other languages.


### FPGA based Speech Recognition [old]
[PDF](/uploads/SpeechRecognition_RicdaSilva.pdf)

Lots of fun at the intersection of programmable logic and embedded software.

This is mostly obsolete now, neural networks are the way to do speech recognition.


### Cache Performance Modelling in QEMU [old]
[PDF](/uploads/CachePerformance_RicdaSilva.pdf) and [the code](https://github.com/rmhsilva/qemu)

Extended the MIPS CPU implementation in QEMU, adding a decent cache model.

Also obsolete (who uses MIPS?), but good fun learning about one of the only two
hard things in computer science (naming things, and cache invalidation. ~ Phil
Karlton).


### MVC (holographic) Video [old]
[PDF](/uploads/MVC_RicdaSilva.pdf), and [an overview poster](/uploads/MVC_Poster_RicdaSilva.pdf).

Research project into compression and transmission of multiview (3D holographic)
video data.
