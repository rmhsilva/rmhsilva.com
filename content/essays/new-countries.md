[@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis/) has [recently proposed](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country/#task) how futuristic countries may come about. This seems enabled by a combination of dissatisfaction at existing governments[1] and new technologies (blockchains and cryptocurrencies, in particular) which are prompting ideas of radically different social structures. It's an interesting and thought-provoking idea.

In March 2021, [Balaji spoke with Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan/) for _over 3 hours_ (one of Tim's longest interviews) about this and several other mind-bending topics, reaching _millions_ of listeners. This episode might go on to become one of his most important episodes. Or possibly the most comical. Either way, why should society remain the way it is now anyway? Of course it'll change. And since innovation seems to [happen simultanously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery), there are probably other people thinking about crazy new country structures[2].

**So what's Balaji (and friends) doing?**

He has a new project called [1729](1729.com/). It's a kind of community, and I'm intrigued.

In starting a community, he's doing what many people have done before, but with a really important change: he's building an economic model of participation into it which rewards value-adding activities like learning skills (education) or being healthy (healthcare) with cryptocash that holds value outside the community. It's a bit like someone offering to pay you lots to quit your job and move across the ocean to join their startup.

Except he's doing this with the whole world, and it's a community he's starting, not a business.

This has been done before, or is being done by other people (eg the Roam Research community maybe starting a [ranch in Utah](https://twitter.com/webdevMason/status/1343661853180743680) and living together under the iconic/heroic Conor). But maybe not at this scale.

## So how could this play out?

# Very Postitively

Let's assume he has the funds to support $5000 ($100 for the first 10 submissions for 5 tasks) per week for 5 years ($1.3M).

Several million people begin participating in this community

Shared beliefs are established, built around real economic value (and therefore minimising spam/trolls)

Gradually, people who interact online start to move closer together offline, because some things are just easier and nicer to do offline (eg have dinner together).

Physical communities form, like many other [existing physical communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_communities_in_the_United_Kingdom)

**The members of this "diaspora" become influential outside the community**. This is really the cornerstone of the theory, and depends on the community being filled with people interested in adding value. Are [Balaji's heuristics](https://1729.com/a-newsletter-that-pays-you/#detail) for this sufficient? The critical ones might be:

* Willingness to do "tasks" (work) for others
* Interest in personal health (decreasing need for a healthcare system)
* Desire to learn (which increases the quality of task work and compounds in value)
* Willingness to invest financially in the community

# Very negatively

People become jaded and leave. Possible reasons:

* Unhappy with governance
* Insufficient real liquidity or value creation
* Some unknown reason

## Metrics

Balaji includes some metrics for his country.

### Population

An obvious one. One less obvious by-product if this metric is highly public is that it may encourage people to spread the word, prompting FOMO just like you get when you see a green stock ticker.

### On-chain GDP

I love this metric, because [measuring](https://www.whatmatters.com/the-book/) it will encourage economic activity to move on-chain.

There will be (even more) really interesting dynamics with local governments as this happens. For example, if you are earning, investing and spending Bitcoin in a "foreign nation", what should your local tax contribution really be, and why? How could that happen?

Earning

* If you're providing value to someone online, cryptocurrency is the most efficient way to compensate you. Think this is a strong statement? Consider the work required to transfer traditional currency, making sure to include _all_ the work, and not just the energy used by the network infrastructure at transaction time. The bulk of the energy consumed by traditional currency is actually in the financial institutions, the people working at those institutions, the laws (and lawyers) to govern it, etc. Next to that _huge_ energy expenditure, Bitcoin might seem pretty green. And there are new blockchains offering more efficient systems (though there are [stability arguments](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs/blob/master//other_blockchains/proof_of_stake.md) and philosophical arguments[3] against this).
* So it's likely that compensation in cryptocurrency will increase and eventually (mostly) replace traditional currency.

Investing

* Like traditional currency, crypto can be invested, loaned, and otherwise used to grow wealth.

Spending

* Why isn't this happening already? Probably regulation.

### Acreage

And here the virtual community is tied into something undeniably and measureably physical. As noted previously, there's _a lot_ of real-estate wealth held by people who became rich on-chain. It's likely these people would be interested in this new state, as it'll be full of other people like them (network effects).

It's worth mentioning that, similar to futarchy, this is something that [@zack_bitcoin](https://twitter.com/zack_bitcoin) has been thinking about [for Amoveo](https://twitter.com/zack_bitcoin/status/1379753364985155587).

## Questions and Thoughts

How is policy created?

* Could this country use a [futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy)-based system? [Amoveo](https://amoveo.io/) is one crypto-currency experimenting with futarchy built into the protocol.

What's the critical mass?

* There's a growing gap between those who believe in crypto, and those who don't. There are already many [Bitcoin millionaires](https://balajis.com/the-billionaire-flippening/). If this continues, and it seems likely it will, then at some point it'll be extremely hard to catch up with those who believed from the beginning, and at that point, those people are their community with their own financial moat.
* Even if the blockchain growth doesn't continue, maybe there's already enough "off-chain" wealth which was created "on-chain" that those wealthy people (and their ideologies) can bootstrap a very real new physical community.

What could we throw away?

* How much baggage do our current governing or societal structures carry which we could throw away in Balajistan? Policy is organisational scar tissue (something bad - a wound - happens, and a the policy - a scar - forms in its place). Some institutions are clearly outdated

  - Banks and classical financial institutions (DeFi + Blockchain are inevitable)
  - Schools (glorified day-care -> guided creativity)
  - Legal systems (lawers -> blockchain programmers & mathematicians)

Where will it be?

* When this thing is reified, where will it physically be? Which countries will allow such a self-governing state to exist in their territory?
* One option to start: take, for example, a small US state, and convince enough people of influence there to join, so that, over time, this state effectively _turns into_ the Balaji-state. The new state would have to abide by the same federal laws, but internally would be full of the new state values and culture. This probably isn't optimal as US immigration laws will prevent many people from taking part.
* Instead of congregating in one place, the more likely (and simpler) scenario is that this society would congregate in multiple physical places simultaneously. This could begin with local meetups over the next year or two. The people attending those meetups would be the early-adopters, and those keen to build, so would probably be keen to, for example, move close together, begin working together in spare time, etc.

How soon could this all happen?

* Are we building this thing for us, or for our children?

What about a military?

* As the china-taiwan conflict reminds us, brute force and violence is still very much in vogue.

**Notes**

[1] - Is this a good proxy at dissatisfaction with life in general, and so is the government able to regain their reputation with some clever policy changes? Or is this a one-way change?

[2] - _If_ societal change is fuelled by technological change, as it feels it might be, and if technological change is accelerating due some compounding effects, we should expect society to change **more** in the next 100 years than it did in the last 100 years. This is not necessarily true; technological change tends to come in unpredictable steps.

[3] - Proof of stake allows the rich to get richer (rewards are a percentage of staked amount, resulting in compound growth for the stakers). Proof of work allows anyone to do "an honest day's work for a days wage". Counter-argument: the difficulty of that day's work has increased to a point where the wage isn't worth it for most people.
