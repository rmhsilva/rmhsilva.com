title: "2020: A Year Of Serverless"
date: 2021-01-23
tldr: Serverless is not a hype, but the tooling needs lots of work. There is opportunity for new paradigms and lots of value to be created.

*I spent most of 2020 working with Serverless systems, and this is a summary of
my thoughts and findings.*

Here's a controversial statement: cloud engineers are not programmers. The
industry (including me) is building cloud applications like hardware, not
software. Most cloud teams have a heavily waterfall (!) style process, though
they won't admit to it.

There's a requriements gathering phase, a design phase, an implementation phase,
and a test phase (all of this usually spread over several weeks). Care is taken
at every step to plan things because infrastructure, like hardware, is hard.

Shouldn't we aspire to treat cloud applications just like real software?

Serverless technology (cloud functions, not platforms) is moving us in the right
direction, but isn't there yet.


## Microservices are an anti-pattern?

Why do we use microservices?

1. Simple replacement of service components (deployment)
2. Separation of concerns
3. Multiple programming languages in one system
4. Other reasons?

Problems they cause:

- Rigidity and brittleness, leading to up-front design work.
- Testing complexity
- Waterfall-style development (services, agree on apis, implement, integrate,
  test).

Microservices done badly are just [distributed monoliths][monoliths], which are
10x worse than normal monoliths, because network unreliability.

Are they an anti-pattern which only exist because current deployment methods
aren't good enough, and the application abstractions are leaky? Maybe we
formally optimise structure because there isn't a compiler which can optimise it
for us).

Could we apply traditional software engineering approaches to cloud systems?

For example, if we had a C/C++ program with multiple components, we would
compile each component individually, and then link them together to form the
complete application. We could let multiple teams work on the complete
application - each team builds libraries (microservices).

If our cloud deployment system was smart enough, it could iteratively deploy the
application, so we eliminate all the reasons to use microservices (except the
multiple languages reason).


## Serverless - Soft Infrastructure

There aren't that many ways to build serverless projects, [Serverless
Framework][sls] is great for small projects, but if you're doing something
bigger, you'll need to understand AWS.

Cloud functions are probably commodities -- most cloud providers have them and
prices are being driven downwards and performance is shooting upwards. This is
great for us, so I spent a big chunk of 2020 (during the Covid-19 lockdowns)
working on a different approach to serverlesss computation.

The key goal was to take the orchestration logic out of the programmers hands,
so that a "compiler" can determine the optimal infrastructure and glue logic.
Just like a C/C++ compiler determines the optimal sequence of CPU instructions.
The novel contribution was to allow the programmer to use cloud functions as
threads in a concurrent programming language. This is then general and poweful
enough to implement any kind of workflow.

The implementation comprises a runtime (virtual machine) and a compiler. The
runtime defines semantics for concurrent computation distributed across multiple
threads. The compiler maps programs into infrastructure for specific cloud
providers.

Secondary goals:

- Development speed

- Portability - as the programmer does not directly specify the infrastructure,
  one could define compilers and runtime environments for any cloud.
  
- Zero infrastructure management - programmers shouldn't be doing
  infrastructure, because infrastructure is hardware.

Result: [Hark][hark].


## Some questions

**Is it better to build a new language and VM, or implement a cloud-native
runtime for an existing language/VM (eg Python or Go)**

- C is heavily designed for a specific CPU architecture, which is precisely what
  allows you to build performant programs in it. Why should cloud be different?

- Go might be "trivially" portable.

**Is a turing complete language *really* necessary to describe the kind of
systems we implement in the cloud? Or is a workflow language sufficient (ie,
Airflow, Dagster et al)?**

- My gut is that programmers using workflow-style systems eventually try to
  write "proper" programs in the workflow style, because that's what programmers
  do.

**Could we build something like Hark on top of Firecracker to orchestrate
functions?**

- This could reduce the startup overhead...

- But it'd be a *new* platform, and would compete with AWS Lambda. Probably not
  a great idea.

**How do we make data sharing?**

Storage and sharing data across threads is slow, because there's network traffic
and we can't control the placement of our containers in AWS's infrastructure.
Are we just waiting for someone to build a better database? (distributed
database optimised for specific workloads).


## Reading Material

Quite a few institutions and clever people are thinking about ways to formalise
serverless computation. This is great!

> **Formal foundations of serverless computing**.  Jangda, A., Pinckney, D.,
> Brun, Y., & Guha, A. (2019). Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,
> 3(OOPSLA), 1–26. https://doi.org/10.1145/3360575

- Great academic paper which lays out a formal lamdba calculus for distributed
  computation across cloud functions, encapsulating the execution semantics
  (retries, etc).

> **Formalizing Event-Driven Behavior of Serverless Applications**.  Obetz, M.,
> Patterson, S., & Milanova, A. (2019). http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03584

- Another nice formal definition of operation semantics for serverless systems.

> **The Stanford Builder (GG)**.
> https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc19-fouladi.pdf

- Some great work at Stanford. The ffmpeg demo is incredible.

> **The Design of Stateful Serverless Infrastructure**.
> https://www.vikrams.io/papers/thesis.pdf

- A completely new platform for stateful "serverless" computation. Very nice
  work; bold move to entirely replace AWS Lambda / GCF.

> **Serverless: I’m a big kid now**.
> https://www.simplethread.com/serverless-im-a-big-kid-now/

- A great summary article of serverlesss in 2020.
