## Working on Hark

Continuing to work on my [open source](https://condense9.com) project from last
year.


## Cloud software consultancy

Helping to build new corporate cloud systems part-time.


## Living in Cambridge, UK

Still can't seem to leave this place. When I first moved, I thought I'd be here
a year.


## Learning about crypto

All the cool kids are doing it, and most people think they're crazy.


## Other things

Another secret project that will become public soon if all goes well.
