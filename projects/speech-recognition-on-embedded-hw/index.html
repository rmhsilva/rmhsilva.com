<p>The final report is available for download <a href="/projects/speech-recognition-on-embedded-hw/Final_Report.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Overview (adapted&nbsp;abstract)</h2>
<p>The aim is to investigate speech recognition on embedded hardware, and in particular, Hidden Markov Based speech recognition. The project makes use of two new electronic boards, based on a Spartan 3 <span class="caps">FPGA</span> and an ARMv5 Linux applications processor, that are currently under development at the University of&nbsp;Southampton.</p>
<p>Speech data is pre-processed in Linux, by performing spectral analysis followed by a Discrete Cosine transformed filterbank analysis, to produce Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. Given this observation data, the <span class="caps">FPGA</span> performs the most computationally intensive part of a modern HMM based speech recognition system — evaluating the state emission&nbsp;probabilities.</p>
<p>It is shown that the <span class="caps">FPGA</span> is capable of performing these calculations faster than a software implementation on the Linux&nbsp;processor.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The project involved a fairly wide variety of technology, but focussed on implementing a mathematical operations pipeline in SystemVerilog, and a controller application in C.  The overall system is shown&nbsp;below.</p>

<p>The L&#39;Imperatrice board is an embedded Linux platform, and La Papessa is the <span class="caps">FPGA</span> development board. These are the two boards mentioned in the&nbsp;abstract.</p>
<p>Please see the report for an in depth discussion of the complete&nbsp;project.</p>
