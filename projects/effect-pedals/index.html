<hr>
<p>My school didn&#39;t have an electronics course.  I was forced to discover it on my own, which I quite happily did.  Apart from going through a variety of electronic hobby kits and similar sandboxed projects, I built several guitar effect&nbsp;pedals.</p>
<p>I frequently visited the amazing <a href="http://www.tonepad.com/">Tonepad</a> website, and finally got my act together and started building boards.  To date I&#39;ve built 5 pedals, none of which quite followed the schematics on&nbsp;Tonepad.</p>
<h3>Combo&nbsp;box</h3>
<p>My first attempt at pedal building was interesting, because it was the first time I‘d ever done something this complex, and the first time I’d ever etched a board.  I used a permanent marker to draw the traces, as I didn‘t have a laser printer at hand.  For etching, I hijacked my school’s chemistry lab assistant and managed to get some Ferric Chloride.  The final results were sketchy, but they worked, and they did what they were designed&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>I built three boards in this manner, and put them into a custom acrylic combo box with one input and one output.  The effects&nbsp;were</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tonepad.com/project.asp?id=5">Orange Squeezer</a>&nbsp;(Compression)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tonepad.com/project.asp?id=48">Purple Peaker</a> (Hi/Lo frequency&nbsp;booster)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tonepad.com/project.asp?id=49">Blue Clipper</a>&nbsp;(Distortion)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully I&#39;ll have some pictures I can put up&nbsp;soon…</p>
<h3>Preamp</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tonepad.com/project.asp?id=31"><span class="caps">EH</span> booster</a> was an absurdly simple build, which sounded really good with my custom <a href="/projects/homebuilt-guitar">guitar</a>.</p>
<p>I actually just built the whole thing on stripboard, and covered it all up with masking&nbsp;tape.</p>
<h3>Il&nbsp;Griton</h3>
<p>My latest pedal was the <a href="http://www.tonepad.com/project.asp?id=49">Il Griton</a>, which is an Ibanez Tube Screamer clone.  Unfortunately it took a while because I started it at university.  I ordered the Tonepad <span class="caps">PCB</span> for this one, because I didn&#39;t have the time or resources to make one myself, and I felt it was too complex for&nbsp;stripboard.</p>
