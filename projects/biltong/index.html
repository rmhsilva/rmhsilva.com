<p>For those who don‘t know what biltong is: you’re missing out. I had the pleasure of growing up in a country <a href="/aboutme/">where</a> it was readily and cheaply available. Unfortunately, in my present location, the only shops that sell biltong charge an exorbitant amount for it, which I suppose is understandable due to the low price elasticity of demand for it (i.e., those who want it are willing to pay high prices for it). So, for the poor student who desperately wants his biltong fix, the solution is simple: make your own. I&#39;ve wanted to make biltong for a while, and finally got my act together this&nbsp;summer.</p>

<h2>Make a biltong&nbsp;box!</h2>
<p>The box itself is no more than an empty 22&quot; Sony flatscreen <span class="caps">TV</span> cardboard box that has been modified for purpose. It is about 45cm tall, 80cm wide, and 15cm deep, and has hanging space for about 3 strips of biltong. Openings are cut at either end to allow for airflow, and part of the lid is taped down to facilitate sealing the box. I added tinfoil lining to insulate it and help the light reach all parts of the hanging meat. <a href="/projects/biltong/#box">Pictures</a></p>
<p>In order to dry the meat efficiently, the humidity in the box must be kept low. I enjoy electronics, and so the humidity controller in my box is far more complicated than it needs to be. All you really need is a 40-60W light bulb to provide heat, and a fan to create airflow through the box. In warmer locations the light bulb may not be necessary, but airflow is essential. Naturally, having the bulb will speed up the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>My box has a 60W light bulb, and a 12V fan. However, the fan is <span class="caps">PWM</span> controlled, which means that I have variable speed control. This requires some form of PWM generator, and some form of controller, which I implemented with an ATtiny 85 and a few lines of code. The entire thing is a bit of a hack job, as I didn&#39;t have all my tools available at the time, and I really wanted to start making biltong as quickly as&nbsp;possible!</p>

<h2>Power&nbsp;circuitry</h2>
<p>The main part of the circuit is the power management stuff, bringing mains voltage down to the various levels required. A 6V-0-6V transformer is used to bring the <span class="caps">240VAC</span> down to 12VAC, which becomes about 17V after rectification with a diode bridge and 1000uF capacitor. This is because the transformer is rated for RMS output — to get the DC output with low ripple, multiply 12V with sqrt(2). Forward voltage drop across the diodes decreases this, but not enough to affect anything&nbsp;adversely.</p>
<p>Two voltage regulators were used — 5V (7805) for the <span class="caps">AVR</span> circuitry, and 12V (7812) for the fan. This could have been accomplished in several different ways, but I happened to have both regulators on hand, and as I said, I was in a hurry. These are linear voltage regulators which need a supply voltage several volts higher than their rated output. My supply was above 15V, which worked&nbsp;perfectly.</p>
<h2>Controller</h2>
<p>The fan requires <span class="caps">PWM</span> at around 25kHz — anything else won‘t work. Initially I tried using a 555 IC to generate the PWM signal, but my trim-pots were far too non-linear, resulting in a highly fluctuating output frequency. I had a spare ATtiny sitting in a breadboard, so this was used instead. It outputs PWM on one pin, and reads in a voltage on another pin. This lets me control the duty cycle, and thus the fan speed, by adjusting the trim-pot. The code is… really quite ugly, to be honest — another consequence of being in a hurry. It works though, and it’s not terribly&nbsp;inefficient.</p>
