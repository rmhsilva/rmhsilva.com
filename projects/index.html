<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As demand increases for visually detailed and immersive media, efforts to achieve better transmission schemes also increases. 3D displays are a relatively novel technology, and there are many different ways of creating a 3D viewing experience. This report investigates compression and transmission schemes for multi-view and stereoscopic video, and presents implementation results of simple motion compensation and <span class="caps">DPCM</span> codecs. A block based motion estimation codec is designed, which is shown to work better than frame differencing, especially for video sequences with high amounts of motion. A tree based motion search algorithm was shown to be far less complex, with only a small reduction in quality, when compared with an exhaustive search. Furthermore, a differential pulse code modulation codec is implemented and paired with motion compensation, which reduced the energy of signals to be transmitted. Finally, the motion compensation codec is used to predict right from left frames in stereoscopic video, but it is found to be unsuited to this task. For these simple algorithms, it is more efficient to simply encode the streams&nbsp;separately.</p>
