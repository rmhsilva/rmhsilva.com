<p>As part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Middle_Years_Programme"><span class="caps">MYP</span></a>, I was required to do a Personal Project — essentially a ‘large’ project of my choosing, that would take about 3 months (including a report).  I chose to build a guitar.  I played a lot of acoustic guitar at the time, but really really wanted an electric guitar, and it seemed a good idea at the time.  It resulted in a very usable guitar that I played at both my <span class="caps">MYP</span> and IB&nbsp;graduations.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>The most obvious result of my project is that it gave me a working electric guitar, but more than that, it taught me a lot about the process of designing and building something yourself.  Compromises had to be made, and things went wrong, but the result was definitely worth&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>My biggest regret is not doing the electronics myself.  Unfortunately it was already an expensive project, and buying individual components would have bumped the cost up substantially.  I had to settle for a pre-made Fender style pickguard + pickup combo. My next guitar will have a custom (probably active) pickup system, with built-in tuning/equalisation/preamp&nbsp;electronics.</p>
