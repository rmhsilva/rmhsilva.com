<hr>
<p>I haven‘t been this surprised by an event for a while. Based on the accounts of other people who’d attended <span class="caps">UKESF</span> workshops in the past, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything too special. In all sincerity, the last week really was&nbsp;special.</p>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know, the <span class="caps">UKESF</span> is an organisation that was created with the primary purpose of increasing interest in the UK electronics industry. Some (many) young people seem to think that other engineering degrees (mechanical, etc.) are more appealing, and many electronics students are being pulled into the financial sector. Strange, I know. The UKESF runs a prestigious scholarship scheme, and I was selected to be a UKESF scholar this year (sponsored by Broadcom Europe Ltd). Part of the scheme involves a summer workshop, which is run by UKESF and Semta and which was hosted by the University of Bristol this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>Many people haven‘t heard of the <span class="caps">UKESF</span>, and most people don’t understand how beneficial it is to be a UKESF scholar. I hope that this post helps change that&nbsp;situation.</p>
<h2>Brief outline of&nbsp;events</h2>
<p>The workshop was 5 days long, from Monday to Friday, and involved a variety of different activities. In general, these were either practical exercises, or presentations by industry specialists. We were also given a unique tour of the Airbus Filton site, where, among other things, every <span class="caps">A400M</span> wing in existence is constructed. It goes without saying that the tour was very interesting, whether you‘re interested in aerospace or not. I don’t think we realised just how important a role the electronic systems play in the testing and actual make-up of the&nbsp;aircraft.</p>
<p>We had several high ranking executives giving talks on one day, including Nigel Toon (<span class="caps">XMOS</span>), Steve Allpress (Nvidia), and Alison Burdett (Toumaz). These were interesting as they had very different backgrounds, and could advise on several different areas of the industry. Also, it&#39;s always beneficial to get to talk to high-ranking executives who are interested in hiring graduates just like&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>We had talks from various other professionals, on topics including career development planning, corporate ethics, lean manufacturing, and negotiation skills (including a particularly interesting practical experiment). The career development talks focussed on the option of becoming a Chartered Engineer. I‘d never really considered it before, but after this, I certainly will. It’s essentially another qualification, but it&#39;s protected by law — not just anyone can become&nbsp;chartered.</p>
<p>Finally, we had the chance to speak to a selection of younger engineers, who were only 5 or so years into their careers. This was the most useful to me, as these are people who, just a few years ago, went through the same process we are going through now. They&#39;d followed different paths, so it was good to compare and contrast&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p>On the first day, we were split into teams of 5-6 people, and over the course of the week, we worked on a ‘project’. There were several different projects, but the general idea was that we had to come up with a solution to a corporate problem, and present our plans on the last day. The project didn’t involve any actual electronics. It was designed to get us thinking about the more commercial aspects of engineering, and it was an enjoyable team&nbsp;experience.</p>
<h2>Primary benefits&nbsp;gained</h2>
<p>For me, the best thing about the workshop was how much it clarity it gave to my career direction and objectives. As a final year student, I‘m getting ready to make some important choices over the next few months, mainly in terms of which area to work in, and with what type of company. I’ve already made some decisions about my career, such as the fact that I want to be an engineer rather than enter management, or finance. However before this week, that was all I‘d decided, and to be honest I wasn’t even 100% sure about&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I know the areas of electronics that interest me — communications, mixed signal <span class="caps">IC</span> design, systems engineering, embedded hardware/software. However, this hasn&#39;t helped me much in terms of deciding where to work. Big company? Small company / startup? Build an electronics startup myself? PhD? Engineering Chartership? Europe? The USA? Australia??! These are all career paths I&#39;ve considered, and tried to decide&nbsp;between.</p>
<p>Being exposed to a fairly diverse collection of successful professionals over the past week has given me a chance to see what sort of career paths are possible. Naturally, being able to talk to them on a personal basis is the real bonus, as I was able to ask very specific&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>I came away from the workshop with a fairly good vision in my mind of how I would like my career to develop. Better still, I was able to talk to various people at the workshop who gave me both advice and important&nbsp;connections.</p>
<p>Besides this, I was surprised to find myself really enjoying the interactive sessions of negotiation and lean manufacturing. I usually find such sessions to be too artificial or over-engineered and thus boring. However, that was not the case at all&nbsp;here.</p>
<h2>Final words (read: Final&nbsp;encouragement)</h2>
<p>I must reiterate — I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the workshop. To me, this is the type of workshop that would normally cost several hundred pounds to attend, and I was in fact being paid to go. If you‘re considering the <span class="caps">UKESF</span> scholarship, it’s probably worth applying, just to get the chance at next year‘s workshop. If you’ve never heard of the UKESF, talk to your university, and find out why you haven‘t. If you’re not at university yet, I can&#39;t stress enough how rewarding a degree in electronics&nbsp;is. </p>
